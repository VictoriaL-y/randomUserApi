Using the Random User Generatot API I created a page with **20 photos** (repeating twice) of users with their **names** and **flags** according to nationality, social media **icons** that have different colors corresponding to the sex of the person taking from the API response.

I completed this project in two ways:
1) using _fetch_
2) using _ajax_
